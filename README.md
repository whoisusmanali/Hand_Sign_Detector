# Hand Sign Detector by using YOLOv8
In this project I used my own dataset by clicking my own pictures and annotate these images by using MakeSense.com and use YOLOv8 for training and test on Vs Code.


## Steps Involved:
1. Data collection:<br>
    In this section I use my own dataset by clicking my own pictures with different signs from different posses. In this process I use Python Programming language use to     collect the data.
2. Image Annotation:<br>
    Image annotion is also done by myself by using MakeSense.com (Make Sense) website and store label in separate files and images into separate files.<br>
    ### Screenshot while Data Annotation:
    
    
3. Data spliting:<br>
    The total data which includes labels and images got divided into 3 different folders train, test and valid which is further divided into images and lebels folders.
    The split percentage is 70% , 20% and 10% respectively.
4. Model training:<br>
    The model got training on Google Colab on YOLO v8 from ultralytics and good pretty much good results.<br>
    ### Sreenshots of Results:
5. Testing:
    The testing of the model is completly done on PyCharms with Using different libraries and run on completely by using my own webcam. And try to detect the objects.
